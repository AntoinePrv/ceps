Conda is an Open Source project with a diverse and wide-ranging ecosystem.

To better allow community members to provide feedback and proposals
for Conda's implementation, all major changes should be submitted as
Conda Enhancement Proposals (CEP).

These proposals are similar to conda-forge's [CFEP](https://github.com/conda-forge/cfep),
[Python's PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) and [IPython's IPEP](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEPs:-IPython-Enhancement-Proposals) processes etc.

Community members are encouraged to author a CEP to suggest changes *before*
any code is written to allow for the community to discuss the proposed changes.

The formal process by which CEPs should be authored and how they are reviewed
and resolved is specified in CEP-01.

A template for new CEPs is given in CEP-00.
