## Abstract

There are many things that would allow Conda contributors to get a clearer sense of what is expected from them, and format things so that communication is in general better. Even seemingly small quality of life improvement could add up to a large impact. We can look to other notable OOS projects for inspiration for this. Some include [FastApi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) or [Tensorflow ](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

Note that there will be a few proposals within this one ... we shall call them "many-conda enhancement proposals". This isn't an all or nothing and can pick to do some, none, or all. Some of these might warrant their own CEP


## Changes that could be made

1. Adding emoticons to PRs to quickly show what the intent of it is. üõ†Ô∏è for refactor, üêõ for bug fix, etc (examples [here](https://gitmoji.dev/))
1. Enforcing linting on PRs
1. Make use of the "Discussions" tab to add and facilitate conversations and help
1. PR template. No more guessing what it should look like or assuming everyone will know it  


## Motivation 

There seems to be a lot of areas around Conda that could be improved with small updates

Other relevant sections of the proposal.  Common sections include:

    * Specification -- The technical details of the proposed change.
    * Motivation -- Why the proposed change is needed.
    * Rationale -- Why particular decisions were made in the proposal.
    * Backwards Compatibility -- Will the proposed change break existing
      packages or workflows.
    * Alternatives -- Any alternatives considered during the design.
    * Sample Implementation -- Links to prototype or a sample implementation of
      the proposed change.
    * FAQ -- Frequently asked questions (and answers to them).
    * Resolution -- A short summary of the decision made by the community.
    * Reference -- Any references used in the design of the CEP.
