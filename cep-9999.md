## Abstract

Introduce a `--compat-level` option to `conda-index`


## Motivation

Conda-build 3.20.5 introduced support for the PEP-440 "compatible release"
operator (`~=`) in package requirement specifications (AKA MatchSpecs).  A
major consequence of this change is that recent versions of `conda index` may
generate repository index (`repodata.json`) files that include this operator,
which render channels containing these indices incompatible with older
(pre-4.9.1) releases.  This incompatibility is especially of concern to larger
channels, such Anaconda's defaults and conda-forge, that use the latest
conda-build in their package build process but still need to support a
significant user base using older conda releases.

To resolve this compatibility issue, we propose adding a `--compat-level=x.y`
option to `conda index`, which would require the output `repodata.json` to be
compatible with conda x.y.


## Implementation

* Add `--compat-level` option
* Set `--compat-level=4.9` to include expansion of `~=V.N` to `>=V.N,==V.*`


## Rationale


Alternatives that were considered:

* Make no changes to `conda index` and leave it up channel maintainers to use
  the existing repodata patching.  Rejected because this puts unnecessary
  burden on package and channel maintainers.

* Directly implement the change in `conda index` without adding a new option;
  i.e., have `conda index` always expand `~=V.N` to `>=V.N,==V.*`.  Potentially
  imposes backwards compatibility on users who may not need them.  Does not
  establish pattern for changing compatibility.
